            "Fish breathe by extracting oxygen from water through their gills, which are specialized organs located on either side of their heads.",
            "Most fish are ectothermic (cold-blooded), meaning their body temperature is regulated by the surrounding water temperature.",
            "Fish have a unique sensory system called the lateral line, which allows them to detect vibrations and movement in the water.",
            "Many fish reproduce by laying eggs (oviparous), while others give birth to live young (viviparous). Some species can even change their sex during their lifetime.",
            "Fish exhibit a wide range of colors and patterns, which can serve various purposes, including camouflage, mating displays, and warning signals.",
            "Fish are diverse in their diets; some are herbivores, others are carnivores, and many are omnivores, consuming both plant and animal matter.",
            "Some fish species, like salmon, are known for their long migrations, traveling thousands of miles between their breeding and feeding grounds.",
            "The lifespan of fish varies widely; some species live only a few years, while others, like certain types of rockfish, can live for over 200 years."
